This is socket.io notes: 
so we use socket programming to implement multiple connections with the single server, in real time we make use of this in:
-chat applications
-sending notifications
-real time tracking of two people on a doc 

socket programming is based on event driven programming

server is an object from socket.io

we create an io object, which takes parameters of the created http server and optional cors methods, 

io has two methods, on and emit
it recieves an event with "on", send arg is function to perform
and it sends through "emit", second arg is just value

creating the client event from frontend, we need to make use of cdn link of socket
and here we create a socket variable that connects with the backend socket's URL.
now we send the event "connect" which validdates that connection is established.

io.on sends an event-> "connection", which client recieves again with the same event name.

from frontend basic-> an event is gonna be emitted as "chatMessage" here, which will be recieved by backend with the same event name.

socket.broadcast.emit sends the events to all the clients connected except self
io.emit sends to all
